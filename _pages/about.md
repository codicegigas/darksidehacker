I am a Student of PhD. in Information Sciences and Technologies at the [Universidad Aut√≥noma Metropolitana - Iztapalapa](https://pcyti.izt.uam.mx), I am interested in embedded systems, computer vision, machine learning, reinforment learning.
I am also enthusiastic about programing & electronics.

Outside of computer science, I enjoy playing video games, playing guitar, and simply sightseeing!
